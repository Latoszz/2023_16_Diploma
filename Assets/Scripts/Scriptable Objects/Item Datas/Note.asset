  text: Where the sound can be heard so similar to the sea and where the wind blows
    my hair. Lies a part valued by many, an object about which they sang in songs.
    You will not reach it by path, but not far away lives a family of frogs. Who
    have long since forgotten, but you do not forget that there you cannot see it,
    only the weight that rests on it.
