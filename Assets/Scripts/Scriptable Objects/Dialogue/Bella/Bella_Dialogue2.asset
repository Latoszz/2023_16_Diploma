  sentences:
  - Thank you for finding my watering can!
  - It looks good, only the plants lack water. So that was a really big help, I don't
    know how I could repay you.
  - Oh I know, please take this flower tea. Talia loves it, so I'm sure you'll like
    it too.
  - I'm sorry darling, but I haven't asked for your name yet. What's your name, my
    dear?
  - 'Oh dear, you don''t remember?

    What would you like me to call you?'
  - 'Athy...

    That''s a nice name!'
  - Now Athy, could you help me get to Talia? I can't get through this fog by myself.
  - As soon as you see her, please come get me, I'd be happy to talk to her.
