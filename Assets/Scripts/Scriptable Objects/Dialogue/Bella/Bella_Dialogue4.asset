  sentences:
  - Oh, it's good to see you, Athy.
  - Thank you so much for bringing me the shovel, darling.
  - And changing the subject, how do you like our village?
  - Oh, you haven't met the rest yet, in which case I have a favor to ask you.
  - Could you take these vegetables to Kiryl? Because of all the fog, I haven't taken
    anything to the tavern for him lately.
  - It's best if you go to Talia and find out where you could find him, she lives
    much closer to him.
  - Oh, you don't have to hurry, honey. I'm sure it won't make much difference to
    him at this point.
