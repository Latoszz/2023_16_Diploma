  - What, you saw Talia in the fog? What did she say?
  - ...
  - I know she wasn't aggressive, but she's not my Talia.
  - Here, take this, it should help you free her.
  - Talia is normally very energetic, scatterbrained and dizzy. That's how you'll
    be able to tell if she's back to herself.
  - Thank you, my dear, I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay you for helping
    our little village.
  - Good luck!
