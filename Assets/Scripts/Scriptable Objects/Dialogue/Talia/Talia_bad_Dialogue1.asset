  - Oh Bella,  I think you forgot about our meeting that was supposed to take place
    5 days 4 hours and 32 minutes ago.
  - Can you tell me why you didn't come?
  - "Unfortunately I don't have time to continue our conversation because I have
    plans to go fishing now.\r"
  - Come between 12 and 1 pm, then I have some time to set a date for the meeting.
    Now bye.
