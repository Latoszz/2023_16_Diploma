  sentences:
  - Thank you for saving me from the Fog's influence. I was so awful.
  - I would like to ask you for help, although you've helped me so much already...
  - Can you help me find my watering can? I think I dropped it when I was coming
    back from a friend's house.
  - Oh, you're not from around here?
  - Looking at you, I don't think I've seen you here before. But back to your question,
    to get to Talia, you have to follow this path.
  - 'Oh yes, I thought you asked about this earlier. '
  - Our small village is located in the middle of the forest, there are five inhabitants
    living here. And guests who usually stay at the tavern, of course.
  - Okay, now I need to check if everything is OK with my garden. So unfortunately
    I have to excuse myself for a moment.
  - Oh, and don't forget my watering can!
