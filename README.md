# Witchy Duels

This repository contains the source code and assets for a diploma thesis project developed at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology [PJAIT](https://pja.edu.pl/en/), Extended Reality, Games and Immersive Systems spec.

## Overview

The project appears to be developed primarily in **C#** and is structured for use with the **Unity** game engine. It integrates third-party tools, such as **DOTween** (a fast, efficient, fully type-safe object-oriented animation engine for Unity), and includes custom modules and graphical assets. The repository likely demonstrates advanced Unity programming, animation management, and modular asset usage as part of the diploma thesis.

## Features

- **Unity Engine Project**: Built for Unity, leveraging its powerful 2D/3D capabilities.
- **C# Scripting**: Core logic and animation scripting handled in C#.
- **DOTween Integration**: Uses DOTween and its modules for smooth, complex animations of UI, sprites, physics, and more.
- **Modular Card System**: Includes modular 2D card assets (from Pixel Life Studio) for creating and customizing card visuals.
- **Editor and Asset Organization**: Assets and scripts are organized for extensibility and ease of use in larger Unity projects.

## Directory Structure

- `Assets/Plugins/Demigiant/DOTween/`: DOTween plugin and modules for handling animations and tweens.
- `Assets/Graphics/Modular Cards DEMO/`: Modular card graphics and documentation for easy card creation and customization.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Latoszz/2023_16_Diploma.git
    ```
2. **Open in Unity**:
